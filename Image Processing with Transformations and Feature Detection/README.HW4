Overview
This assignment requires you to apply basic image processing techniques, including edge and corner detection, to an original image. After detecting edges and corners, you will perform a series of geometric transformations on the image and reapply the detection methods.

Task Description
Feature Detection on Original Image

Edge Detection: Implement an edge detector (such as the Canny edge detector) to identify and highlight edges in the image.
Corner Detection: Use a corner detector (like the Harris corner detector) to identify and highlight corners.
Output: Generate two images:
Image with edges highlighted.
Image with corners marked.
Geometric Transformations and Feature Re-Detection

For each of the following transformations, apply both the edge detector and corner detector to the transformed image:
Rotate the original image by 60 degrees.
Scale the original image by a factor of 1.6 in both the x and y directions.
Shear the original image in the x-direction by 1.2.
Shear the original image in the y-direction by 1.4.
Implementation Details
Input/Output:

Input an image file from the user.
Output should include the original image with detected features and the transformed images with their respective detected features.
Transformations:

Rotation: Use a rotation matrix to rotate the image.
Scaling: Apply a scaling transformation matrix to enlarge the image.
Shearing: Use a shearing matrix for the x and y directions respectively.
Detection Algorithms:

Implement or use in-built functions for Canny edge detection and Harris corner detection.
Ensure that each detection algorithm correctly interprets the pixel data post-transformation.
Edge and Corner Visualization:

Edges can be highlighted by tracing them with a distinct color (e.g., red).
Corners can be marked using a small circle or a different color (e.g., blue).
