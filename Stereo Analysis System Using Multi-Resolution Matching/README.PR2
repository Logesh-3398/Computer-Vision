Overview
In this assignment, you will design and implement a stereo analysis system capable of performing multi-resolution matching using both region-based and feature-based methods. The system will employ disparity checks and interpolations to ensure the validity and accuracy of stereo matching across different resolution levels.

Task Description
Multi-Resolution Matching:

Develop a system that allows matching at various resolution levels, using disparity from lower resolutions as initialization for higher resolutions.
Ensure that region-based matching is used at the topmost level of resolution.
Matching Methods:

Region-based Analysis:
Allow users to select the size of the matching template and window, which can be square or rectangular.
Implement the following matching scores:
Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD)
Sum of Squared Differences (SSD)
Normalized Cross-correlation (NCC)
Feature-based Analysis:
Use Harris corner detection for feature extraction and various matching scores (SAD, SSD, NCC) for comparing the descriptor values.
Validity Check and Disparity Gap Filling:

Implement a validity check to ensure that matches from the left-to-right image comparison correspond to those from the right-to-left.
Use averaging within a defined neighborhood window or quadratic fits to fill gaps in disparity maps where matches do not correspond.
System Configuration and User Input:

Allow users to set the number of resolution levels and adjust the template size and search neighborhood for each level.
Provide interfaces for users to input or select parameters and execute the stereo matching process.
Data and Evaluation:

Utilize stereo image pairs from the provided data source (Middlebury Stereo Vision Page).
Assess the systemâ€™s performance by evaluating the disparity maps generated and comparing them using known benchmarks from the data source.
Deliverables:

At least three results for each of five different stereo pairs, each with a comprehensive readme file that explains the result and indicates the parameters used.
A zipped directory containing all source code, data used, and necessary files, ready for submission.
